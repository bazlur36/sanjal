## 💡 COMMUNICATION TIPS

### **What Client Wants to Hear:**

✅ **Concrete numbers** ("35 topics migrated" not "many topics")
✅ **Visible progress** (screenshots, before/after)
✅ **Expected impact** (10-20 daily visitors)
✅ **Clear next steps** (monitor for 2 weeks)
✅ **Timeline** (when to expect results: 2-3 weeks)

### **What to Avoid:**

❌ Too much technical detail (backup methodology, SQL queries)
❌ No numbers (vague "made improvements")
❌ Only promises (show what you DID, not what you'll do)
❌ Long explanations without bullets/formatting

### **Tone:**

- ✅ **Confident:** "Completed migration of 35 topics"
- ✅ **Action-oriented:** "Optimized 4 titles"
- ✅ **Results-focused:** "Expected 10-20 daily visitors"
- ❌ Uncertain: "I think this might help..."
- ❌ Passive: "Topics were moved..."
