ROBOTS.TXT EXPLAINED - SANJAL.COM
================================================================================
A Simple Guide to Understanding Your Site's robots.txt Configuration
================================================================================

WHAT IS ROBOTS.TXT?
================================================================================
robots.txt is a text file that tells search engines and bots:
- Which pages they CAN crawl/index
- Which pages they SHOULD NOT crawl/index
- Where to find your sitemap

Think of it as a "rulebook" for web crawlers visiting your site.

================================================================================
YOUR CURRENT ROBOTS.TXT BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

SECTION 1: SITEMAP DECLARATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sitemap: https://sanjal.com/sitemap.xml

✓ WHAT IT MEANS: 
  Tells all search engines where to find your sitemap (the index of all 
  important pages on your site).

✓ WHY IT'S IMPORTANT:
  Helps Google, Bing, and other search engines find and index your content
  faster and more efficiently.

================================================================================

SECTION 2: GLOBAL RULES (User-agent: *)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These rules apply to ALL bots and crawlers unless specified otherwise.

🚫 BLOCKED AREAS (Disallow commands):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Administrative & System Pages
   Disallow: /admin/
   Disallow: /auth/
   Disallow: /email/
   Disallow: /session
   Disallow: /my
   Disallow: /user-api-key
   
   WHY? These are backend/admin pages that:
   - Have no SEO value
   - Could expose sensitive functionality
   - Waste crawl budget (Google's time)

2. User Profiles (IMPORTANT DECISION)
   Disallow: /u/
   Disallow: /users/
   Disallow: /p/
   
   WHY? The configuration blocks user profile pages because:
   - They're considered "low-quality" for SEO
   - Focus is on CONTENT (discussions/topics), not individual users
   - Saves crawl budget for more valuable pages
   
   TRADE-OFF: User profile pages won't appear in search results

3. Search & Navigation Pages
   Disallow: /search
   Disallow: /g
   Disallow: /badges
   Disallow: /groups/
   
   WHY? These are utility pages that:
   - Generate duplicate content
   - Don't provide unique value in search results
   - Waste crawl budget

4. Duplicate Views & Parameters
   Disallow: /*?print=
   Disallow: /*?order=
   Disallow: /*?status=
   Disallow: /*?ascending=
   Disallow: /*?descending=
   Disallow: /t/*/*.rss
   Disallow: /c/*.rss
   
   WHY? Blocks different views of the same content:
   - Print versions
   - Sorted views
   - RSS feeds
   These would create duplicate content issues in search results

5. Tracking & API Parameters
   Disallow: /*?api_key*
   Disallow: /*?utm_*
   Disallow: /*?ref=*
   
   WHY? Prevents indexing of URLs with:
   - API keys (security)
   - UTM tracking parameters (duplicate content)
   - Referral codes (duplicate content)

✅ ALLOWED AREAS (Allow commands):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allow: /uploads/
Allow: /stylesheets/
Allow: /images/

WHY? Explicitly allows search engines to access:
- User-uploaded images and files
- CSS files (for rendering previews)
- Site images

This helps with:
- Google Image Search
- Rich snippets in search results
- Proper page rendering in search previews

================================================================================

SECTION 3: THE "AI GREEN LIST" (Explicitly Welcome AI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These rules give special permission to AI bots.

✅ ALLOWED AI BOTS:
User-agent: GPTBot (ChatGPT - OpenAI)
User-agent: CCBot (Common Crawl - trains most AIs)
User-agent: Google-Extended (Google's AI)
User-agent: ClaudeBot (Anthropic's Claude AI)
User-agent: anthropic-ai
User-agent: PerplexityBot (Perplexity AI)
User-agent: Applebot-Extended (Apple Intelligence)

All set to: Allow: /

✓ WHAT IT MEANS:
  AI companies can train their models on your content and answer questions
  about topics discussed on Sanjal.com.

✓ WHY IT'S VALUABLE:
  - Increases brand visibility through AI chatbots
  - When people ask AI questions, they might get answers from Sanjal
  - Free marketing and traffic source
  - Positions Sanjal as an authoritative source

✓ TRADE-OFF:
  AI companies use your content for free to train their models.

================================================================================

SECTION 4: BLOCKED SCRAPERS (SEO/Marketing Tools)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚫 BLOCKED BOTS:
User-agent: mauibot
User-agent: semrushbot
User-agent: ahrefsbot
User-agent: blexbot
User-agent: seo spider
User-agent: MJ12bot
User-agent: DotBot

All set to: Disallow: /

✓ WHAT IT MEANS:
  SEO tools and competitor analysis bots are blocked.

✓ WHY BLOCK THEM:
  - They consume server resources without providing value
  - They don't bring traffic (unlike Google or AI bots)
  - Used by competitors to analyze your content strategy
  - Can slow down your site for real users

✓ RESULT:
  Saves bandwidth and protects competitive intelligence.

================================================================================

SUMMARY: IS THIS CONFIGURATION GOOD?
================================================================================

✅ PROS:
1. Clear sitemap declaration for search engines
2. Optimized crawl budget - focuses on valuable content
3. Prevents duplicate content issues
4. Welcomes beneficial AI bots for visibility
5. Blocks resource-wasting SEO scrapers
6. Follows Discourse best practices

⚠️ CONSIDERATIONS:
1. User profiles are blocked - this is intentional but means:
   - Individual users won't appear in search results
   - Focus is 100% on discussion content
   - This is a common strategy for forums/communities

2. AI bots are allowed - this means:
   - Your content trains AI models
   - You get free promotion through AI responses
   - But AI companies profit from your content

================================================================================

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS
================================================================================

DO:
✓ Keep this configuration (it's well-optimized)
✓ Monitor Google Search Console for crawl stats
✓ Ensure important content pages are being indexed
✓ Check that sitemap is properly submitted to GSC

CONSIDER:
? If you WANT user profiles in search results, you could remove:
  - Disallow: /u/
  - Disallow: /users/
  - Disallow: /p/
  
  But this is generally NOT recommended for forums focusing on content.

? If you DON'T want AI training on your content, you could change all
  AI bot rules from "Allow: /" to "Disallow: /"
  
  Trade-off: Less visibility through AI chatbots.

DON'T:
✗ Don't block important content pages
✗ Don't remove the sitemap declaration
✗ Don't allow SEO scraper bots (they provide no value)

================================================================================

QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR CLIENT
================================================================================

1. Are important discussion topics appearing in Google search results?
   If NO → Problem is likely NOT robots.txt (it's properly configured)
   → Check Google Search Console for actual indexing issues

2. Do you WANT user profile pages to appear in search results?
   If YES → Need to remove the /u/, /users/, /p/ blocks
   If NO → Current configuration is correct

3. Are you comfortable with AI bots using your content?
   If YES → Current configuration is correct
   If NO → Need to block AI bots

================================================================================
