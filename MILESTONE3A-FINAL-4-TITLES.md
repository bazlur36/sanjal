## 📋 THE 4 THREADS TO OPTIMIZE

- Current Position: 4.61 (TOP 5!)
- Monthly Impressions: 54 (HIGHEST volume)
- Current Clicks: 0
- CTR: 0%

Problem: Generic title doesn't match search intent

How to Find:
1. Search forum for "nepal vs uae" or "uae cricket"
2. Or use Admin → Posts → Search "UAE"
3. Look for cricket match discussion thread

Current Title (likely):

- Adds "Cricket Match" (clarifies topic)
- Includes "2026" (shows it's current)
- Adds value words: "Live Updates, Analysis & Discussion"
