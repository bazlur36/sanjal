SUBJECT: Re: GSC Analysis Complete - Sitemap Working, Content Quality is the Real Issue

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thanks for the GSC access. I've reviewed the data and have good news: **your sitemap is working perfectly** - it's successfully delivering 4,840+ pages to Google. The issue is that Google is crawling these pages but choosing not to index them due to content quality signals, not technical problems.

I've prepared a comprehensive action plan with admin-level fixes you can implement immediately (no codebase access needed) that should get 800-1,000 pages indexed within 6 months. There are also 14 technical errors (404s/5xx) to fix in Week 1. Would you like me to share the implementation guide?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi [Client Name],

Your sitemap works perfectly - Google is finding and crawling 4,840+ pages. The problem is Google won't index them due to content quality, not technical issues. I've created an admin-level action plan to fix this (800-1,000 pages indexed in 6 months). Ready to share when you are.
