# DAY 2-3: Title Optimization Guide
## Emergency Title Audit for High-Ranking Nepal Threads

**Date:** January 20, 2026  
**Task:** Fix titles on threads already ranking positions 3-11  
**Priority:** URGENT - You're losing traffic due to poor titles!  
**Time Required:** 1-2 hours  
**Expected Impact:** 0% CTR → 5-10% CTR (instant traffic boost)

---

## 🚨 THE PROBLEM

You're already **ranking on first page** (positions 3-11) for Nepal queries but getting **ZERO clicks**!

**Why?** Bad titles that don't match search intent.

**Example:**
```
User searches: "nepal vs uae"
Your thread title (probably): "Match discussion" or "UAE game"
User sees in Google: Generic title with no context
User's action: Skips your result, clicks someone else
Your CTR: 0% 😱
```

## 🎯 4 HIGH-PRIORITY THREADS TO FIX NOW

These threads are **already ranking well** - just need better titles!

### **Thread 1: Samajik Sanjal Meaning** 
```
GSC Data:
- Search Query: "samajik sanjal in english" + "samajik sanjal meaning"
- Current Position: #10.04 and #5.88 (first page!)
- Combined Impressions: 27 + 8 = 35
- Clicks: 0 (nobody clicks!)
- CTR: 0%

Problem: Title doesn't answer the translation question

Current Title (likely): 
❌ "Samajik Sanjal"
❌ "About social media"
❌ "Nepal online community"

New Title (EVERGREEN):
✅ "Samajik Sanjal Meaning in English: Nepal Social Media & Community Guide"

Why this works:
- Directly answers "what does samajik sanjal mean?"
- Includes "in English" (exactly what they search)
- Adds "Nepal Social Media" (context)

3. Current year (shows it's updated)
4. Content type (guide, review, discussion, etc.)

Length: 40-60 characters (Google's sweet spot)
```
