================================================================================
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR CLIENT'S CONCERN
================================================================================
If the client believes the sitemap is "not working," it may be due to:

1. Google Search Console Issues
   - Sitemap not manually submitted to GSC yet
   - Recent submissions still being processed (can take days/weeks)
   - GSC showing warnings/errors that need attention

2. Indexing Delays
   - New content not appearing in search results immediately
   - Google takes time to crawl and index pages (can take days to weeks)

3. Crawl Errors
   - Google may be encountering errors when crawling specific URLs
   - Need to check GSC Coverage report

4. Expectations Mismatch
   - Client expecting different URLs or more URLs in sitemap
   - Not understanding the difference between sitemap and indexing

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION:

1. Verify Google Search Console Setup
   - Ensure the site is verified in Google Search Console
   - URL: https://search.google.com/search-console

2. Submit Sitemap to Google
   - In GSC, go to: Sitemaps → Add a new sitemap
   - Enter: sitemap.xml
   - Click Submit

3. Check Coverage Report in GSC
