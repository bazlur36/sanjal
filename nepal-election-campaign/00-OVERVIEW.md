# Nepal Election 2026 Campaign - Executive Overview

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Election Day:** March 5, 2026 (36 days away)  
**Campaign Window:** Time-sensitive, non-recurring opportunity

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Nepal elections on March 5, 2026 present a **once-every-4-5-years opportunity** to capture massive traffic surge and establish sanjal.com as the authoritative Nepal political discussion platform.

### **The Opportunity**
- Election-related search queries spike 10-50x in Feb-March
- Sanjal.com already ranks positions 3-11 for Nepal topics
- Current 0% CTR can be converted to actual traffic with optimized content
- First-mover advantage in Nepal election discussion space

### **The Approach: Automation Handover Model**
- **Bazlur builds:** Complete N8N automation workflow (Week 1)
- **Client manages:** Content generation and posting (Week 2+)
- **Ongoing work:** UI/UX implementation by Bazlur
- **Time commitment (client):** 30-60 min daily after handover

### **The Timeline**
- **36 days until election** - must start NOW
- Google needs 2-3 weeks to index and rank new content
- Peak traffic occurs 1 week before + election day + 3 days after
- Missing this window = wait until 2030-2031 for next cycle
