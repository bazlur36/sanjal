## Time Scenarios:

### **Best Case (3-4 hours):**
Client approves first version with minor changes
- Setup: 0.5 hours
- Testing: 2 hours
- Delivery: 0.5 hours
- One feedback round: 1 hour

### **Realistic (6-8 hours):**
Standard workflow with 1-2 feedback rounds
- Setup: 0.5 hours
- Testing: 2.5 hours
- Delivery: 0.5 hours
- Two feedback rounds: 3-4 hours

### **Maximum (10-12 hours):**
Multiple iterations with significant changes
- Setup: 0.5 hours
- Testing: 3 hours
- Delivery: 0.5 hours
- Multiple feedback rounds: 6-8 hours

## Key Notes:

✅ **CSS is already written** (400+ lines in sanjal-modern-ui-component.css)
✅ **No coding from scratch** - just testing and adjusting
✅ **Main time spent on:**
   - Compatibility testing with FKB Pro theme
   - Responsive/mobile optimization
   - Client feedback iterations

⚠️ **Time could increase if:**
   - FKB Pro has significant CSS conflicts
   - Client requests major design changes
   - Browser compatibility issues arise
   - Need to create custom HTML templates (not just CSS)

---

## Recommendation:

**Quote to client: 6-8 hours**
- Includes initial implementation
- 1-2 rounds of feedback
- Professional testing and delivery
- Realistic buffer for adjustments

This is a fair estimate that covers the work without over-promising or under-delivering.
