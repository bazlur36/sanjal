# CATEGORY INTENT MAPPING GUIDE
## Aligning Forum Categories with Real Search Queries

**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026  
**Purpose:** Ensure your forum categories match what people actually search for  
**Impact:** Critical for ranking - even perfect content won't rank if it's in the wrong category  
**Time Required:** 2-4 hours initial setup, ongoing maintenance

---

## 🎯 WHY INTENT MAPPING MATTERS

### The Problem
Most forums organize by **internal logic**:
```
❌ Categories like:
   - "General Discussion"
   - "Off-topic"
   - "Random"
   - "Miscellaneous"
```

But users search by **specific intent**:
```
✅ Search queries like:
   - "how to get nepal visa"
   - "best trekking routes kathmandu"
   - "nepal cricket team news"
   - "pokhara travel tips 2026"
```

### The Impact
```
WRONG:
Great content about "Nepal visa requirements"
→ Posted in "General Discussion" category
→ Google doesn't understand relevance
→ Page doesn't rank
→ Zero organic traffic

RIGHT:
Same content about "Nepal visa requirements"
→ Posted in "Travel & Visa" category
→ Clear topical relevance
→ Page ranks for visa queries
→ Steady organic traffic
```

### Key Principle
**Categories are not just for organizing your forum - they're for signaling topic relevance to Google.**

---

## 📊 STEP 1: AUDIT YOUR CURRENT CATEGORIES

### Task 1A: List All Categories
**Time:** 15 minutes

**In Discourse Admin:**
1. Go to **Admin → Categories**
2. Export or list all categories
3. Note the category slug (URL part)

**Create a spreadsheet:**
```
Category Name | Slug | Description | # Topics | # Posts
```

### Task 1B: Analyze Category Usage
**Time:** 30 minutes

**For each category, note:**
```
☐ How many topics?
☐ How many total posts?
☐ Most popular topics?
☐ Is it clear what belongs here?
☐ Are topics consistently on-theme?
☐ Engagement level (views per topic)?
```

### Task 1C: Identify Problem Categories
**Time:** 15 minutes

**Red Flags:**
```
🚩 Vague names: "General," "Miscellaneous," "Other"
🚩 Low usage: < 10 topics
🚩 Mixed topics: Everything from politics to recipes
🚩 Duplicate purpose: 3 categories about the same thing
🚩 No description: Users don't know what goes here
```

**Common Issues:**
```
❌ Too many categories (users confused where to post)
❌ Too few categories (everything in "General")
❌ Category names don't match search terms
❌ Categories based on format vs. topic
   Example: "Questions" vs. "Nepal Travel Questions"
```

---

## 🔍 STEP 2: RESEARCH ACTUAL SEARCH INTENT

### Task 2A: Keyword Research
**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Tools to Use (all free):**

1. **Google Search Console (Best Source)**
   ```
   Path: Performance → Queries
   
   What to look for:
   ☐ Queries that already bring traffic
   ☐ Queries with impressions but no clicks
   ☐ Common question patterns
   ☐ Location-specific searches
   ```

2. **Google Autocomplete**
   ```
   Type in Google search:
   - "[your niche] how to"
   - "[your niche] best"
   - "[your niche] tips"
   - "[your location] guide"
   
   Note all autocomplete suggestions
   ```

3. **Google "People Also Ask"**
   ```
   Search your main topics
   Scroll to "People also ask" boxes
   Click to expand related questions
   Document all questions
   ```

4. **Google Trends**
   ```
   URL: trends.google.com
   
   Enter your main topics:
   ☐ Check search volume trends
   ☐ Compare related queries
   ☐ Check regional interest
   ☐ Find seasonal patterns
   ```

5. **AnswerThePublic (Limited Free)**
   ```
   URL: answerthepublic.com
   
   Enter your main keyword
   Get visualization of:
   - What questions people ask
   - Prepositions (about, with, for, etc.)
   - Comparisons
   - Alphabetical queries
   ```

### Task 2B: Competitor Analysis
**Time:** 1 hour

**Find Top Ranking Sites:**
```
1. Google your main topics
2. Note which sites rank #1-5
3. Analyze their category structure
```

**Document:**
```
Competitor | Category Structure | What Works | What Doesn't
-----------|-------------------|------------|-------------
Site 1     | ...               | ...        | ...
Site 2     | ...               | ...        | ...
```

### Task 2C: Create Search Intent Map
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Group queries by intent:**

**INFORMATIONAL INTENT (Learn/Research)**
```
Examples:
- "what is nepal e-visa"
- "how does nepali visa work"
- "nepal visa requirements explained"

Category suggestion: "Visa Information & Guide"
```

**TRANSACTIONAL INTENT (Do/Buy/Act)**
```
Examples:
- "apply for nepal visa online"
- "nepal visa application form"
- "where to get nepal visa"

Category suggestion: "Visa Application Process"
```

**NAVIGATIONAL INTENT (Find somewhere)**
```
Examples:
- "nepal immigration website"
- "kathmandu visa office location"
- "embassy contact number"

Category suggestion: "Visa Resources & Contacts"
```

**QUESTION INTENT (Specific problems)**
```
Examples:
- "can i extend nepal visa"
- "what if my nepal visa is rejected"
- "how long does nepal visa take"

Category suggestion: "Visa FAQ & Common Issues"
```

│ CATEGORY ALIGNMENT:                                            │
│ ☐ Perfect - Category name matches search terms                │
│ ☐ Good - Category is relevant but name could improve          │
│ ☐ Fair - Category is too broad or vague                       │
│ ☐ Poor - Category doesn't match user intent                   │
│                                                                 │
│ RECOMMENDED ACTION:                                            │
│ ☐ Keep as-is                                                  │
│ ☐ Rename to: _____________________________                    │
│ ☐ Split into: _____________ and _____________                 │
│ ☐ Merge with: _____________________________                    │
│ ☐ Delete (redirect to: ______________)                        │
│                                                                 │
│ NEW/UPDATED DESCRIPTION (SEO-optimized):                       │
│ _________________________________________________________      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Task 3B: Complete Worksheet for Each Category
**Time:** 2-3 hours (depending on # of categories)

**Example - BEFORE:**
```
Category Name: "General Discussion"
Slug: /c/general
Description: "Talk about anything"
Topics: 847
Assessment: ❌ TOO VAGUE - No search intent alignment
```

**Example - AFTER MAPPING:**
```
Discovered Search Queries:
- "nepal current affairs"
- "nepal news today"
- "latest nepal politics"
- "nepal economy updates"

Recommended New Category: "Nepal Current Affairs & News"
New Slug: /c/nepal-news
New Description: "Discuss latest news, politics, economy, and 
current affairs in Nepal. Stay updated with breaking news, 
government policies, economic developments, and social issues 
affecting Nepal today."

Search Intent: Informational (news/updates)
Monthly Volume: Medium (5k-10k)
Action: Rename + move relevant topics
```

---

## 🔧 STEP 4: IMPLEMENT CATEGORY RESTRUCTURING

### Task 4A: Plan the Migration
**Time:** 1 hour

**Create Migration Plan:**
```
PHASE 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
☐ Rename vague categories to keyword-rich names
☐ Update all category descriptions (SEO-optimized)
☐ Add category images/icons

PHASE 2: Content Reorganization (Week 2-3)
☐ Move misplaced topics to correct categories
☐ Merge duplicate categories
☐ Create new categories if gaps exist

PHASE 3: URL Management (Week 3-4)
☐ Set up redirects for old category URLs
☐ Update sitemap
☐ Monitor Google Search Console
```

### Task 4B: Rename Categories
**Time:** 30 minutes - 1 hour

**In Discourse Admin:**
```
1. Admin → Categories → [Category Name] → Edit
2. Update Name (keyword-rich)
3. Update Slug (SEO-friendly)
4. Update Description (200-300 words, keyword-rich)
5. Save changes
```

**Naming Formula:**
```
[Location/Niche] + [Topic] + [Intent/Type]

Examples:
❌ "Travel Talk" → ✅ "Nepal Travel Tips & Guides"
❌ "Tech Stuff" → ✅ "Nepal Technology & Gadgets"
❌ "Q&A" → ✅ "Nepal Visa Questions & Answers"
❌ "Sports" → ✅ "Nepal Cricket & Sports News"
```

**Best Practices:**
```
✅ Include location/niche in category name
✅ Use words people actually search for
✅ Be specific about what belongs here
✅ Keep under 60 characters
✅ Avoid jargon or internal terms
❌ Don't use vague words: "General," "Other," "Misc"
❌ Don't use format as category: "Questions," "Discussions"
❌ Don't use humor that isn't searchable
```

### Task 4C: Write SEO-Optimized Descriptions
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Template for Category Description:**
```
[Category Name] - [One-line value proposition]

[2-3 sentences explaining what this category is about, using natural 
keyword variations]

Popular topics include:
• [Subtopic 1 - with search query]
• [Subtopic 2 - with search query]
• [Subtopic 3 - with search query]

[1-2 sentences about who should post here and what types of 
discussions are encouraged]

Related categories: [Link to 2-3 related categories]
```

**Example:**
```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEPAL VISA INFORMATION & TRAVEL PERMITS

Everything you need to know about obtaining visas, permits, and 
travel documents for Nepal. Get accurate information about visa 
requirements, application processes, fees, extensions, and 
immigration procedures for tourists, students, and workers.

visa extension issues, this is your go-to resource for official 
visa information and community experiences.

Related categories: Travel Planning | Living in Nepal | Immigration Support
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Task 4D: Move Topics to Correct Categories
**Time:** Ongoing (15-30 min per day)

**Discourse Bulk Move Process:**
```
1. Go to category with misplaced topics
2. Select topics (checkboxes)
3. Click "Bulk Actions" (wrench icon)
4. Choose "Move to Category"
5. Select correct destination category
6. Move topics
```

**Prioritize Moving:**
```
1. High-quality topics in wrong categories (move first)
2. Popular topics that could rank better elsewhere
3. Topics causing category confusion
4. Duplicate topics (merge + move)
```

---

## 📈 STEP 5: OPTIMIZE FOR SEARCH VISIBILITY

### Task 5A: Create Topic Clusters
**Time:** Ongoing

**Concept:** Hub and Spoke Model
```
        ┌─────────────────────┐
        │  CATEGORY PAGE      │
        │  (Nepal Visa Hub)   │
        │                     │
        └──────────┬──────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────┼──────────┐
        │          │          │
    ┌───▼──┐   ┌──▼───┐   ┌─▼────┐
    │Topic │   │Topic │   │Topic │
    │ 1    │◄──┤  2   │──►│  3   │
    └──────┘   └──────┘   └──────┘
                   │
              All topics link to:
              - Category hub
              - Related topics in cluster
              - Other relevant categories
```

**Implementation:**
```
1. Create comprehensive "About [Category]" pinned topic
2. Link all major topics to this hub
3. Add contextual links between related topics
4. Link to other relevant category hubs
```

### Task 5B: Add Structured Data (If Possible)
**Time:** 1-2 hours (may require developer)

**Schema.org Markup for Categories:**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CollectionPage",
  "name": "Nepal Visa Information",
  "description": "Complete guide to Nepal visa requirements...",
  "url": "https://sanjal.com/c/nepal-visa",
  "hasPart": [
    {
      "@type": "DiscussionForumPosting",
      "headline": "How to Apply for Nepal Visa Online",
      "url": "https://sanjal.com/t/..."
    }
  ]
}
</script>
```

**Note:** Discourse may have built-in schema. Check theme for existing implementation.

### Task 5C: Internal Linking Strategy
**Time:** Ongoing with content improvements

**Rules:**
```
FROM: New/updated topic posts
TO: Related discussions

Linking priorities:
1. Within same category (topic to topic)
2. To category "About" hub
3. To related categories
4. To site-wide resources

Link placement:
✅ Natural, contextual mentions within post content
✅ Descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
✅ 2-4 links per post (don't overdo it)
❌ NOT in sidebar/footer (less SEO value)
❌ NOT in automated signatures
```

---

## 🎯 CATEGORY RESTRUCTURING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Travel Forum

**BEFORE (Poor Intent Mapping):**
```
1. General Travel
2. Trip Reports
3. Questions
4. Transportation
5. Accommodations
```

**AFTER (Search Intent Aligned):**
```
1. Nepal Trekking Routes & Guides
   → Ranks for: "nepal trekking routes," "annapurna trek guide"
   
2. Kathmandu Valley Travel Planning
   → Ranks for: "things to do kathmandu," "kathmandu itinerary"
   
3. Nepal Visa & Entry Requirements
   → Ranks for: "nepal visa requirements," "how to get nepal visa"
   
4. Nepal Transportation & Getting Around
   → Ranks for: "kathmandu to pokhara bus," "nepal domestic flights"
   
5. Nepal Hotels & Guest Houses
   → Ranks for: "best hotels kathmandu," "pokhara accommodation"
```

### Example 2: Technology Forum

**BEFORE:**
```
1. General Tech Discussion
2. Help & Support
3. News
4. Off-topic
```

**AFTER:**
```
1. Nepal Internet & ISP Reviews
   → "best internet provider nepal," "wifi speed kathmandu"
   
2. Mobile Phones & Electronics Nepal
   → "buy iphone kathmandu," "smartphone price nepal"
   
3. Nepal Tech Startups & Innovation
   → "tech companies nepal," "startup ecosystem kathmandu"
   
4. Computer Hardware & Building PCs Nepal
   → "where to buy pc parts nepal," "graphics card price kathmandu"
```

```
❌ "Team Member Introductions"
❌ "Site Announcements"
❌ "Forum Games"

✅ Instead: Hide these from search or keep minimal
```

### Mistake 2: Too Many Categories
```
Problem: 50+ categories = confused users + diluted authority

Solution: 8-15 main categories, use subcategories if needed
```

### Mistake 3: Format-Based Categories
```
❌ "Questions"
❌ "Reviews"
❌ "Discussions"
❌ "Polls"

✅ Instead: Organize by TOPIC, not format
```

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Category Descriptions
```
❌ "Discuss travel here"
❌ "Talk about technology"

✅ 200-300 word SEO-rich descriptions with keywords
```

### Mistake 5: Static Categories
```
❌ Set categories once, never review

✅ Review quarterly, adjust based on search trends
```
