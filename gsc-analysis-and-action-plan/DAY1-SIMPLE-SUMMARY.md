# DAY 1 SIMPLE SUMMARY
## Category Intent Mapping - Key Findings

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM (In 3 Points)**

1. **NBA content gets 85% of impressions → 0% clicks** (wasted)
2. **Nepal content gets only 5% impressions → BUT ranks positions 4-11** (first page!)
3. **Your titles don't match what people search for** (easy fix = big gains)

---

## 💡 **THE SOLUTION (Simple)**

### **Focus on Nepal, Not NBA**

**Why?**
- You already rank on page 1 for Nepal topics
- Just need better titles to get clicks
- Forum format perfect for Nepal community
- NBA = impossible to compete with ESPN
