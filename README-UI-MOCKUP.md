Hi Laxman,

I'm working on creating a visual HTML mockup based on the Dribbble reference you shared - the "combo of reddit + threads + quora" design for Sanjal.com.

I'll share the mockup with you within tomorrow for your approval before implementing anything in Discourse.

The mockup will show:
• Clean, modern look with whitespace (Threads-inspired)
• Card-based topics with shadows (Reddit-inspired)
• Professional, minimal design (Quora-inspired)
• Using actual Sanjal topics (Nepal Cricket, E-Passport, ChatGPT, etc.)

Once you approve the design direction, I'll implement it in Discourse via a theme component.

Will update you tomorrow with the mockup!

Best,
Bazlur

Hi Laxman,

I've created the visual HTML mockup for Sanjal.com based on the Dribbble reference.

MOCKUP FILE: sanjal-homepage-mockup.html (attached)
- Open it in any browser to see the design
- Uses actual Sanjal topics (Nepal Cricket, E-Passport, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Shows modern card-based layout with clean typography
- Mobile-responsive

Design elements:
• Clean, modern look with whitespace (Threads-inspired)
• Card-based topics with shadows (Reddit-inspired)
• Professional, minimal design (Quora-inspired)

NEXT STEP:
Once you approve this design direction, I'll implement it in Discourse via a theme component. The actual implementation will achieve 70-80% of this mockup's visual style while working within Discourse's structure.

Please review the HTML mockup and let me know if you approve, or if you'd like any changes to the design?

Best,
Bazlur

## Next Steps

1. Share mockup with client
2. Get feedback on design direction
3. Make adjustments if needed
4. Once approved → Implement in Discourse via CSS
